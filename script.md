slave in the magic mirror, 
come from the farthest space,
through wind and darkness.
I summon thee. Speak!

Let me see thy face

What wouldst thou know? My Queen?

Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all

Famed is thy beauty majesty, but hold, a lovely maid I see.

Rags cannot hide her gentle grace. Alas, she is more fair than thee

Alas for her! Reveal her name!

Lips red as the rose. Hair black as ebony

Skin white as snow

Snow White?
